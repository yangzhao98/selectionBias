## selectionBias

A collection of papers for exploring and correcting selection bias


1. **SelectionBias2SMR_V2.R** is used to perform simulation studies to investigate the impact of selection bias, as described in this paper "Gkatzionis & Burgess *Int J Epidemiol* 2018;48(3):691-701."

2. **SurvivalBias.R** is used to eliminate survival bias in two-stage instrumental variable estimators, as described in this paper "Vansteelandt et al. *Epidemiology* 2018;29:536-541."

3. **SurvivalBias_FG.R** is used to assess the magnitude and direction of selection bias in two-sample MR settings, as described in this paper "Schooling CM, ..., Yang Z, et al. *Front Genet* 2021;15:11:610852."
